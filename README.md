## Single Player - Puzzle Game
This is a game concept, the player is living in a 2 dimensional plane and has to walk through obstacles towards the blue block. The user can rotate the plane in order to see which obstacles are in the way

## Multiplayer - Hide & Seek Tag
The "Hider" is the blue block and gets to see in the 3D perspective and "Seekers" are red blocks with only access to the 2D world and have to tag the "Hider"
